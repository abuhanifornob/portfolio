        With a solid background in IT support, I am now transitioning into
        full-stack web development. I bring a unique perspective to web
        development, combining my technical troubleshooting expertise with a
        strong foundation in web technologies. My experience includes network
        settings, camera configuration, PC support, and software installation,
        which has honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
        whatever we believe about ourselves and our ability comes true for us. I
        am a quick learner and passionate about learning new skills always
        maintain integrity & believe that no legacy is so rich as honesty <br />
        <br /> I have completed the Programing Hero Lavel-1 and Lavel-2 Courses,
        where I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React,
        Node.js, Express Js, MongoDB, Typescript, Redux, and other web
        technologies. I am passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly
        web applications and am eager to leverage my IT background in a
        full-stack development role
